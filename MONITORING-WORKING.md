# n8n Monitoring - Working Solution ‚úÖ

## The Issue

n8n v1.94.1 does not expose workflow execution metrics through Prometheus. The metrics like `n8n_workflow_executions_total` that we expected are not available.

## The Solution

Created a new dashboard "n8n Basic Monitoring" that uses the metrics that ARE available.

## Available Dashboards in Grafana

### 1. üü¢ n8n Basic Monitoring (WORKING)

This dashboard shows:

- **Service Status**: Up/Down indicator
- **n8n Version**: Current running version
- **Active Workflows**: Number of active workflows
- **Start Time**: When n8n was started
- **CPU Usage**: Real-time CPU percentage
- **Memory Usage**: RSS, Heap Used, and Heap Total
- **Event Loop Lag**: Node.js performance indicator
- **Active Resources**: Handles and requests
- **GC Duration**: Garbage collection performance

### 2. üî¥ n8n Complete Monitoring (Limited Data)

This dashboard expects workflow metrics that don't exist in v1.94.1:

- Workflow executions (no data)
- Success rate (no data)
- Execution duration (no data)
- Only the "n8n Status" panel works

### 3. üü¢ PostgreSQL Monitoring (WORKING)

Shows database metrics when using PostgreSQL:

- Connection usage
- Transaction rates
- Cache hit ratio
- Row operations

## How to Access

1. **Open Grafana**: <http://localhost:3000>
2. **Login**:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `secure-grafana-password`
3. **Navigate**: Dashboards ‚Üí Browse
4. **Open**: "n8n Basic Monitoring" for working metrics

## What You Can Monitor

### ‚úÖ Available Metrics

- Service health and uptime
- Resource usage (CPU/Memory)
- Node.js performance
- Process information

### ‚ùå Not Available (in v1.94.1)

- Workflow execution counts
- Workflow success/failure rates
- Execution duration
- Webhook metrics

## Workarounds for Workflow Monitoring

1. **Use n8n UI**: Check executions at <http://localhost:5678/workflow/executions>
2. **Use n8n API**: Query `/rest/executions` endpoint
3. **Monitor Logs**: `docker logs -f n8n-local`

## Files Created/Updated

- ‚úÖ `docker/grafana/dashboards/n8n-basic-dashboard.json` - Working dashboard
- ‚úÖ `docs/monitoring-limitations.md` - Detailed explanation
- ‚úÖ `docker/grafana/dashboards/provider.yml` - Fixed provisioning config

## Next Steps

1. Use the "n8n Basic Monitoring" dashboard for available metrics
2. Check n8n's UI for workflow execution details
3. Consider implementing custom metrics collection via n8n's API
4. Monitor n8n releases for improved metrics support

## Important Notes

- The lack of workflow metrics is a limitation of n8n v1.94.1, not our configuration
- All infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana) is working correctly
- When n8n adds these metrics in future versions, the "Complete Monitoring" dashboard will automatically start working
